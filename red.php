	<h1>Brief about the book</h1>
	<p>A young girl, Little Red Riding Hood, sets off through the woods to visit her sick grandmother. Along the way, she meets a wolf. The wolf rushes ahead of her to her grandmothers home, where he impersonates Little Red Riding Hood to gain access. The wolf eats the grandmother. When Red arrives, the wolf pretends to be her grandmother and eats her too.

Earlier versions end the tale here. No happily-ever-after for Red or her grandmother. Recent versions, including the version by the Brothers Grimm, have Red and her grandmother survive and defeat the wolf.

In the Brothers Grimm version, a huntsman kills the wolf and frees Red and her grandmother. It then tells a brief tale of another trip through the woods resulting in Red and her grandmother besting a wolf on their own.
Soon after, a huntsman came by the house and heard snoring. He entered cautiously, saw the sleeping monster in granny's bed and guessed what happened. Then he opened the sleeping wolf's stomach with a knife.
Granny and Red Riding Hood came out and helped the huntsman fill the wolf's stomach with stones. When the wolf woke up, he tried to run away, but the stones were too heavy. He fell down and died. Grandmother, granddaughter, and huntsman lived happily ever after.</p>
